## Credit Score Classification 
This project aims to analyze credit card transactions and classify customers into different credit score categories, such as "Poor," "Standard," or "Good." The classification helps financial institutions evaluate a customer's ability to pay back a loan or the likelihood to default on their debt, aiding in decision-making processes regarding credit approval or denial.
